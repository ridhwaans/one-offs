# pattern-matching
#### Ridhwaan Shakeel

## Description:
This program reads an input and patterns text file, and then finds matches in the input file based on patterns

## Why implement the way I did
Used a switch statement to choose from different pattern matching modes


## Command line instructions:
1) pattern-matching.js is in the same root directory as input.txt and patterns.txt
2) In the root directory, run 'npm install' to install dependencies
3) In the root directory, run 'npm link' to create the NPM executable
4) Enter 'pattern-matching' with no arguments to run the NPM executable

## Dependencies:
