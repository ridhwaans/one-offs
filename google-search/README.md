# google-search
#### Ridhwaan Shakeel

## Description:
This CLI program prompts the user to make a google search and then returns the title and url of the 1st google search result.

## Why implement the way I did
I made the solution in nodejs, using async and promises, because it is simple and effective. 
Nodejs is also a good choice if I had to interate and scale the solution, plus npm is a powerful package manager.


## Command line instructions:
1) In the root directory, run 'sudo npm install' to install dependencies
2) In the root directory, run 'sudo npm link' to create the NPM executable
3) Enter 'google-search' to run the NPM executable

## Dependencies:
